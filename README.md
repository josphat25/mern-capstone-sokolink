# MERN Stack Capstone Project

This assignment focuses on designing, developing, and deploying a comprehensive full-stack MERN application that showcases all the skills you've learned throughout the course.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Plan and design a full-stack MERN application
2. Develop a robust backend with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js
3. Create an interactive frontend with React.js
4. Implement testing across the entire application
5. Deploy the application to production

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Follow the instructions in the `Week8-Assignment.md` file
4. Plan, develop, and deploy your capstone project

## Files Included

- `Week8-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn
- Git and GitHub account
- Accounts on deployment platforms (Render/Vercel/Netlify/etc.)

## Project Ideas

The `Week8-Assignment.md` file includes several project ideas, but you're encouraged to develop your own idea that demonstrates your skills and interests.

## Submission

Your project will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Commit and push your code regularly
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Deploy your application and add the live URL to your README.md
4. Create a video demonstration and include the link in your README.md

## Project Name: SokoLink – Smart Market Access for Small-Scale Farmers
# Problem Statement:
1.Small-scale farmers often struggle with:

2.Lack of access to current market prices

3.Middlemen exploitation

4.Limited visibility to direct buyers or cooperatives

5.Poor record-keeping and loss of income tracking

##  Solution (Your App):
A MERN stack platform that connects small-scale farmers to the marketplace directly.

## Core Features:
1.Live Market Prices: Real-time pricing data for common crops in local and nearby markets.

2. Produce Listings: Farmers can list their crops with quantity, price, and location.

3. Buyer-Farmer Connection: Buyers can filter by crop, location, and contact farmers directly.

4. Sales Dashboard: Visualize income, volume sold, best-performing crops.

5. Alerts System: Notify farmers of price spikes, weather events, or nearby bulk buyer interest.

6. Multilingual Support: Kiswahili & English support for inclusivity.

##  SMART Goals for SokoLink Capstone
Goal	Description
S - Specific	Build a MERN-based web application that connects small-scale farmers with local buyers and gives them access to live market prices and sales tracking tools.
M - Measurable	Complete development of 6 core features (auth, listings, prices, messaging, dashboard, alerts) and deploy both frontend and backend by the end of Week 8.
A - Achievable	Use existing tools (MongoDB Atlas, Vercel, Render, GitHub Actions) and learned skills (React, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, CI/CD) to complete all tasks.
R - Relevant	Addresses a major pain point in agriculture—lack of market access—and empowers farmers through technology.
T - Time-bound	Final deployed product (with CI/CD and documentation) ready in 4 weeks, with weekly milestones for progress tracking.
