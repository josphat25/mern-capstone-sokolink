## Project Name: SokoLink – Smart Market Access for Small-Scale Farmers
# Problem Statement:
1.Small-scale farmers often struggle with:

2.Lack of access to current market prices

3.Middlemen exploitation

4.Limited visibility to direct buyers or cooperatives

5.Poor record-keeping and loss of income tracking

##  Solution (Your App):
A MERN stack platform that connects small-scale farmers to the marketplace directly.

## Core Features:
1.Live Market Prices: Real-time pricing data for common crops in local and nearby markets.

2. Produce Listings: Farmers can list their crops with quantity, price, and location.

3. Buyer-Farmer Connection: Buyers can filter by crop, location, and contact farmers directly.

4. Sales Dashboard: Visualize income, volume sold, best-performing crops.

5. Alerts System: Notify farmers of price spikes, weather events, or nearby bulk buyer interest.

6. Multilingual Support: Kiswahili & English support for inclusivity.
